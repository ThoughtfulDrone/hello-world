Ready to learn
Hey Git hub, I am a 30 year old railroader who has in the last year been very interested in Software engineering and 
databases. Looking to seway into a new industry. I am one year into a master's program with Regis University, but in
this business I realize it is more on what you know as opposed to pieces of paper. So looking to learn and pratice alot 
here. Thanks!
